This is a fork of WowUp that's been modified to do its best not to phone home to WowUp's servers or to force updates

I recommend you visit the [Main WowUp repositories](https://github.com/WowUp/), or if it's gotten even more evil and invasive, just go straight to the max-evil, max-convenience option and hop on the [Overwolf train](https://download.curseforge.com/)
